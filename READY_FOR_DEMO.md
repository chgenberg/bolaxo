**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ 5 CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED  
**Environment:** Railway Production  
**Next Step:** Add email service config

---

## 🎯 FIXES COMPLETED

### ✅ Fix #1: Buyer Email Hidden Until NDA Approved
**What was broken:** Seller could see buyer email when NDA was just requested
**What fixed it:** Updated `/app/dashboard/ndas/page.tsx` to show "Anonym köpare" until status = "approved"
**Result:** ✅ Anonymization working correctly

---

### ✅ Fix #2: View Count Now Increments
**What was broken:** Listing views always showed 0
**What fixed it:** 
- Added `/api/listings/[id]/views` endpoint (POST to increment)
- Added fetch call in `/app/objekt/[id]/page.tsx` on page load
**Result:** ✅ View counts now track correctly

---

### ✅ Fix #3: Duplicate NDA Prevention
**What was broken:** Same buyer could request NDA multiple times for same listing
**What fixed it:** Added check in `/api/nda-requests/route.ts` to prevent duplicates
**Result:** ✅ Database integrity protected

---

### ✅ Fix #4: Real-Time Message Updates
**What was broken:** Messages only appeared after page refresh
**What fixed it:** Added 5-second polling to `/app/dashboard/messages/page.tsx`
**Result:** ✅ Messages update without refresh (every 5 seconds)

---

### ✅ Fix #5: User-Friendly Error Messages
**What was broken:** Users didn't know why NDA requests failed
**What fixed it:** Added `useToast` to listing detail page with error handling
**Result:** ✅ Clear feedback: "Du har redan begärt NDA för denna annons"
