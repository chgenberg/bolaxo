## 🔧 For Developers (Backend Integration)

### High Priority
1. **Integrate NDA PDF generation**
   - NDA requests now save to DB (done ✓)
   - Next: Generate actual PDF to send to buyers
   - Use library: `pdfkit` or `puppeteer`

2. **Implement email notifications**
   ```
   - When NDA created: Email seller
   - When NDA approved: Email buyer
   - Chat message alerts
   ```

3. **Create admin dashboard for NDA moderation**
   - See all pending NDAs
   - Bulk approve/reject
   - View NDA history

### Medium Priority
1. **Add real BankID integration**
   - Remove dev-login before production
   - Integrate with BankID service
   - Secure session management

2. **Implement real-time chat with WebSockets**
   - Current: Polling every 5 seconds
   - Better: Real-time via Socket.io or similar

3. **Add file upload to dataroom**
   - Sellers upload company docs
   - Secure file storage
   - Access tracking

### Lower Priority
1. **Analytics & reporting**
   - Track user journey
   - Monitor NDA approval rates
   - Chat engagement metrics

2. **Performance optimization**
   - Database indexing
   - Query optimization
   - Cache layer

## 💡 Tips for Success

### For Testers
- ✅ Test on different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- ✅ Check mobile version too
- ✅ Take screenshots of issues
- ✅ Document exact steps to reproduce
- ✅ Check the database afterward with `npx prisma studio`

### For Developers
- ✅ Monitor console for warnings
- ✅ Use Network tab to debug API calls
- ✅ Check database state frequently
- ✅ Create comprehensive error messages
- ✅ Add logging for debugging

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations (Acceptable for MVP)

1. **No real BankID** - Uses localStorage dev-auth (development only)
2. **No email notifications** - Implement after core flow validated
3. **No file uploads** - Will add in next phase
4. **No real-time chat** - Polling works but not ideal
5. **No admin moderation** - Manual NDA approval needed for now

---

## 📞 Support & Questions

### If test fails:
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Look at Network tab - are API calls working?
3. Review database with `npx prisma studio`
4. Check implementation files in `/app` and `/contexts`
5. Read error messages carefully - they're descriptive!

### If you get stuck:
1. Look at similar working feature
2. Check Git history for similar implementations
3. Search codebase for similar patterns
4. Ask in team Slack with:
   - What you tried
   - What error you got
   - Screenshot of console
