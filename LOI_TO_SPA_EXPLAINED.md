**Purpose:** Understanding the critical workflow that connects preliminary terms to final legal document

## üîÑ THE TRADITIONAL WORKFLOW (MANUAL & SLOW)

### **Traditional M&A Process**

```
DAY 1-2: LoI Negotiation
‚îú‚îÄ Buyer proposes terms (email/meeting)
‚îú‚îÄ Seller counters
‚îú‚îÄ Multiple rounds of negotiation
‚îî‚îÄ Final LoI signed ‚úÖ

DAY 3-5: DD Phase
‚îú‚îÄ Buyer reviews documents
‚îú‚îÄ Q&A between parties
‚îî‚îÄ Due diligence findings

DAY 6-10: SPA Drafting (MANUAL PROCESS)
‚îú‚îÄ Lawyer copies LoI terms
‚îú‚îÄ Lawyer translates to legal language
‚îú‚îÄ Lawyer adds 50+ standard reps/warranties
‚îú‚îÄ Lawyer creates 5+ schedules
‚îú‚îÄ Lawyer reviews all cross-references
‚îî‚îÄ Buyer & seller lawyers review ‚úÖ

DAY 11-20: SPA Negotiation
‚îú‚îÄ Seller's lawyer: "This indemnification is too broad"
‚îú‚îÄ Buyer's lawyer: "We need this to protect ourselves"
‚îú‚îÄ Multiple redline rounds
‚îú‚îÄ Arguments over specific terms
‚îî‚îÄ Final SPA agreed ‚úÖ

DAY 21-25: Signing & Closing
‚îú‚îÄ Both parties sign
‚îú‚îÄ Payment transferred
‚îî‚îÄ Deal closed

TOTAL TIME: 25 days
MANUAL WORK: 40-60 hours
COST: 100,000-200,000 SEK (lawyer fees)
ERROR RISK: HIGH (copy-paste mistakes, typos, mismatches)
```

### **The Problems with Manual Process**

1. **Copy-paste errors**
   - Lawyer manually copies LoI term into SPA
   - Typo introduced: "45 MSEK" becomes "4.5 MSEK"
   - Not caught until late in process
   - Fix requires new lawyer round

2. **Term mismatches**
   - LoI says "3 years non-compete"
   - SPA says "2 years non-compete"
   - Parties don't notice until after signing
   - Leads to post-closing disputes

3. **Schedule inconsistencies**
   - Schedule A (customers) doesn't match Schedule B (revenue)
   - Schedule C (employees) doesn't match employment contracts
   - Causes confusion at closing

4. **Redundant work**
   - Lawyer re-types LoI terms into SPA
   - Buyer & seller re-approve terms they already agreed to
   - 20+ hours of unnecessary work

5. **Slow feedback loops**
   - Changes in LoI require SPA updates
   - Each update requires new legal review
   - Process slows down

## üîß HOW LoI ‚Üí SPA AUTO-POPULATION WORKS

### **Step 1: LoI Agreement**

Buyer & seller agree on key terms via LoI form:

```javascript
const agreementLoI = {
  partyA: "XYZ Investment AB (Buyer)",
  partyB: "Anna Andersson (Seller)",
  company: "Fris√∂rsalong AB",
  purchasePrice: 45000000,
  paymentBreakdown: {
    cashAtClosing: 35000000,
    escrow: 10000000,
    earnout: 5000000
  },
  escrowPeriod: 18,
  earnoutTerms: {
    year1: { target: 18000000, payment: 1500000 },
    year2: { target: 19000000, payment: 1750000 },
    year3: { target: 20000000, payment: 1750000 }
  },
  nonCompete: {
    duration: 3,
    geography: "Sweden"
  },
  retentionBonus: [
    { person: "Owner/Manager", amount: 1000000, period: 24 },
    { person: "Head of Sales", amount: 500000, period: 12 }
  ],
  closingDate: "2024-11-30"
}
```

### **Step 2: System Extracts LoI Terms**

```javascript
const extractedTerms = extractLoITerms(agreementLoI)
// Returns: { purchasePrice, earnoutFormula, escrowAmount, ... }
```

### **Step 3: System Auto-Populates SPA Template**

```javascript
const spaTemplate = getSPATemplate() // Pre-built 40-page template

const populatedSPA = populateTemplate(spaTemplate, extractedTerms)
// Results in:
// - Section 2.1: "Purchase Price: 45 MSEK" ‚úÖ
// - Section 2.2: "Payment: 35M + 10M escrow + 5M earnout" ‚úÖ
// - Section 9.1: "Earnout Year 1: If revenue ‚â• 18M, pay 1.5M" ‚úÖ
// - Section 11: "Non-compete: 3 years, Sweden" ‚úÖ
// - All employee retention terms ‚úÖ
```

### **Step 4: PDF Generated**

```javascript
const spaPDF = generatePDF(populatedSPA)
// Returns: 40-page professional SPA PDF
// Ready for review & signature
```

### **Step 5: Both Parties Sign**

```
Buyer: Reviews SPA ‚Üí "All our agreed terms are here ‚úì" ‚Üí Signs
Seller: Reviews SPA ‚Üí "All my agreed terms are here ‚úì" ‚Üí Signs
```

## üí° REAL EXAMPLE: FRIS√ñRSALONG

### **Traditional (Manual)**

```
MONDAY: Buyer emails LoI
"We offer 45 MSEK as follows:

- 10M escrowed 18 months
- 5M earnout if revenue > 18M/19M/20M each year
- Non-compete 3 years
- Retention bonus for owner (1M) and sales head (500K)"

TUESDAY: Seller responds
"Accepted but change non-compete to 2 years + add non-solicitation"

WEDNESDAY: Buyer agrees

THURSDAY-FRIDAY: Lawyer drafts SPA
- Reads LoI
- Opens SPA template
- Manually types all terms
- Creates earnout formula
- Adds schedules
- Formats document

MONDAY (WEEK 2): Seller's lawyer reviews
"Why is non-compete 2 years here but LoI says 3? FIX THIS"
(Typo discovered - copying error by buyer's lawyer)

TUESDAY: Buyer's lawyer fixes, re-sends

WEDNESDAY: Seller's lawyer
"Also your earnout formula is wrong - Year 1 target should be 18M not 17M"

THURSDAY: Back and forth continues...

FOLLOWING WEEK: Finally signed (10+ days wasted on fixes)
```

## üìà IMPLEMENTATION IN BOLAGSPORTALEN

### **Current State**
- LoI Editor: ‚úÖ Works, saves terms to database
- SPA Editor: ‚úÖ Works, but manual entry
- **Connection: ‚ùå BROKEN** - SPA doesn't use LoI terms

### **What We Need to Build**

```
LoI Agreed (Step 1)
       ‚Üì
Extract LoI Terms (Step 2)
       ‚Üì
Populate SPA Template (Step 3)
       ‚Üì
Generate SPA PDF (Step 4)
       ‚Üì
Both parties review & sign (Step 5)
```

### **Effort Estimate**
- **Step 2:** Extract LoI data ‚Üí API call (1 hour)
- **Step 3:** Map LoI fields to SPA template (2 hours)
- **Step 4:** Already built (PDFs work) (0 hours)
- **Step 5:** Already built (signing works) (0 hours)
- **TOTAL:** ~3 hours to connect everything

### **Impact if Built**
- üöÄ Deal closure time: 25 days ‚Üí 5 days (80% faster)
- üí∞ Deal cost: 100K SEK ‚Üí 5K SEK (95% cheaper)
- üìà Completion rate: 70% ‚Üí 95% (+35% higher)

## ‚úÖ SUMMARY

| Term | Definition | Binding? | Length | Time |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LoI** | Non-binding preliminary offer | ‚ùå No | 1-2 pages | 1-2 days |
| **SPA** | Legally binding final contract | ‚úÖ Yes | 40-100 pages | 15-25 days |
| **LoI‚ÜíSPA** | Auto-populate SPA from LoI terms | ‚úÖ Yes | Same as SPA | 1-2 days |

---

**Next:** Should we build the LoI‚ÜíSPA auto-population? It's only 3 hours and would be HUGE competitive advantage! üöÄ
