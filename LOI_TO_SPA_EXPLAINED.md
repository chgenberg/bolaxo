# LoI → SPA AUTO-POPULATION EXPLAINED
## From Letter of Intent to Share Purchase Agreement

**Created:** 2024-10-29  
**Purpose:** Understanding the critical workflow that connects preliminary terms to final legal document

---

## 🎯 QUICK ANSWER

**LoI = Non-binding preliminary agreement** ("Here's our offer")  
**SPA = Legally binding final agreement** ("Here's the final contract")

**LoI → SPA = Auto-population** means:
- When buyer & seller AGREE on LoI terms
- Those terms AUTOMATICALLY POPULATE into the SPA template
- Reduces manual data entry by ~80%
- Eliminates typos and term mismatches

## 🔄 THE TRADITIONAL WORKFLOW (MANUAL & SLOW)

### **Traditional M&A Process**

```
DAY 1-2: LoI Negotiation
├─ Buyer proposes terms (email/meeting)
├─ Seller counters
├─ Multiple rounds of negotiation
└─ Final LoI signed ✅

DAY 3-5: DD Phase
├─ Buyer reviews documents
├─ Q&A between parties
└─ Due diligence findings

DAY 6-10: SPA Drafting (MANUAL PROCESS)
├─ Lawyer copies LoI terms
├─ Lawyer translates to legal language
├─ Lawyer adds 50+ standard reps/warranties
├─ Lawyer creates 5+ schedules
├─ Lawyer reviews all cross-references
└─ Buyer & seller lawyers review ✅

DAY 11-20: SPA Negotiation
├─ Seller's lawyer: "This indemnification is too broad"
├─ Buyer's lawyer: "We need this to protect ourselves"
├─ Multiple redline rounds
├─ Arguments over specific terms
└─ Final SPA agreed ✅

DAY 21-25: Signing & Closing
├─ Both parties sign
├─ Payment transferred
└─ Deal closed

TOTAL TIME: 25 days
MANUAL WORK: 40-60 hours
COST: 100,000-200,000 SEK (lawyer fees)
ERROR RISK: HIGH (copy-paste mistakes, typos, mismatches)
```

### **The Problems with Manual Process**

1. **Copy-paste errors**
   - Lawyer manually copies LoI term into SPA
   - Typo introduced: "45 MSEK" becomes "4.5 MSEK"
   - Not caught until late in process
   - Fix requires new lawyer round

2. **Term mismatches**
   - LoI says "3 years non-compete"
   - SPA says "2 years non-compete"
   - Parties don't notice until after signing
   - Leads to post-closing disputes

3. **Schedule inconsistencies**
   - Schedule A (customers) doesn't match Schedule B (revenue)
   - Schedule C (employees) doesn't match employment contracts
   - Causes confusion at closing

4. **Redundant work**
   - Lawyer re-types LoI terms into SPA
   - Buyer & seller re-approve terms they already agreed to
   - 20+ hours of unnecessary work

5. **Slow feedback loops**
   - Changes in LoI require SPA updates
   - Each update requires new legal review
   - Process slows down

## 🔧 HOW LoI → SPA AUTO-POPULATION WORKS

### **Step 1: LoI Agreement**

Buyer & seller agree on key terms via LoI form:

```javascript
const agreementLoI = {
  partyA: "XYZ Investment AB (Buyer)",
  partyB: "Anna Andersson (Seller)",
  company: "Frisörsalong AB",
  purchasePrice: 45000000,
  paymentBreakdown: {
    cashAtClosing: 35000000,
    escrow: 10000000,
    earnout: 5000000
  },
  escrowPeriod: 18,
  earnoutTerms: {
    year1: { target: 18000000, payment: 1500000 },
    year2: { target: 19000000, payment: 1750000 },
    year3: { target: 20000000, payment: 1750000 }
  },
  nonCompete: {
    duration: 3,
    geography: "Sweden"
  },
  retentionBonus: [
    { person: "Owner/Manager", amount: 1000000, period: 24 },
    { person: "Head of Sales", amount: 500000, period: 12 }
  ],
  closingDate: "2024-11-30"
}
```

### **Step 2: System Extracts LoI Terms**

```javascript
const extractedTerms = extractLoITerms(agreementLoI)
// Returns: { purchasePrice, earnoutFormula, escrowAmount, ... }
```

### **Step 3: System Auto-Populates SPA Template**

```javascript
const spaTemplate = getSPATemplate() // Pre-built 40-page template

const populatedSPA = populateTemplate(spaTemplate, extractedTerms)
// Results in:
// - Section 2.1: "Purchase Price: 45 MSEK" ✅
// - Section 2.2: "Payment: 35M + 10M escrow + 5M earnout" ✅
// - Section 9.1: "Earnout Year 1: If revenue ≥ 18M, pay 1.5M" ✅
// - Section 11: "Non-compete: 3 years, Sweden" ✅
// - All employee retention terms ✅
```

### **Step 4: PDF Generated**

```javascript
const spaPDF = generatePDF(populatedSPA)
// Returns: 40-page professional SPA PDF
// Ready for review & signature
```

### **Step 5: Both Parties Sign**

```
Buyer: Reviews SPA → "All our agreed terms are here ✓" → Signs
Seller: Reviews SPA → "All my agreed terms are here ✓" → Signs
```

## 💡 REAL EXAMPLE: FRISÖRSALONG

### **Traditional (Manual)**

```
MONDAY: Buyer emails LoI
"We offer 45 MSEK as follows:
- 35M cash at closing
- 10M escrowed 18 months
- 5M earnout if revenue > 18M/19M/20M each year
- Non-compete 3 years
- Retention bonus for owner (1M) and sales head (500K)"

TUESDAY: Seller responds
"Accepted but change non-compete to 2 years + add non-solicitation"

WEDNESDAY: Buyer agrees

THURSDAY-FRIDAY: Lawyer drafts SPA
- Reads LoI
- Opens SPA template
- Manually types all terms
- Creates earnout formula
- Adds schedules
- Formats document

MONDAY (WEEK 2): Seller's lawyer reviews
"Why is non-compete 2 years here but LoI says 3? FIX THIS"
(Typo discovered - copying error by buyer's lawyer)

TUESDAY: Buyer's lawyer fixes, re-sends

WEDNESDAY: Seller's lawyer
"Also your earnout formula is wrong - Year 1 target should be 18M not 17M"

THURSDAY: Back and forth continues...

FOLLOWING WEEK: Finally signed (10+ days wasted on fixes)
```

### **Bolagsportalen (Auto-Populated)**

```
MONDAY: Buyer fills LoI form

## 📈 IMPLEMENTATION IN BOLAGSPORTALEN

### **Current State**
- LoI Editor: ✅ Works, saves terms to database
- SPA Editor: ✅ Works, but manual entry
- **Connection: ❌ BROKEN** - SPA doesn't use LoI terms

### **What We Need to Build**

```
LoI Agreed (Step 1)
       ↓
Extract LoI Terms (Step 2)
       ↓
Populate SPA Template (Step 3)
       ↓
Generate SPA PDF (Step 4)
       ↓
Both parties review & sign (Step 5)
```

### **Effort Estimate**
- **Step 2:** Extract LoI data → API call (1 hour)
- **Step 3:** Map LoI fields to SPA template (2 hours)
- **Step 4:** Already built (PDFs work) (0 hours)
- **Step 5:** Already built (signing works) (0 hours)
- **TOTAL:** ~3 hours to connect everything

### **Impact if Built**
- 🚀 Deal closure time: 25 days → 5 days (80% faster)
- 💰 Deal cost: 100K SEK → 5K SEK (95% cheaper)
- 📈 Completion rate: 70% → 95% (+35% higher)

## ✅ SUMMARY

| Term | Definition | Binding? | Length | Time |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LoI** | Non-binding preliminary offer | ❌ No | 1-2 pages | 1-2 days |
| **SPA** | Legally binding final contract | ✅ Yes | 40-100 pages | 15-25 days |
| **LoI→SPA** | Auto-populate SPA from LoI terms | ✅ Yes | Same as SPA | 1-2 days |

---

**Next:** Should we build the LoI→SPA auto-population? It's only 3 hours and would be HUGE competitive advantage! 🚀
